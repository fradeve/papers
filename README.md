This repo contains all my published papers, conference proceedings, etc..

* Each folder contains a YAML file with some misc info about the paper.
* LaTeX compiling instructions are hardcoded as comments in the main TeX file;
  special dependencies are mentioned when necessary.
* A poster version of the paper is bundled sometimes, and must be compiled as a separate file.
* Each paper has attached a compiled PDF version.
